# University_Management_System

This university management system project in PHP focuses mainly on dealing with a number of records regarding student attendance, markings, faculties, etc. Also, the system displays all the available records of available faculties, students, and their marks, etc. 

This project is divided into three categories: Admin, Student, and Faculty. 

# Admin Panel:-

In an overview of this web app, the admin has all the main control of the system that includes student attendance management under different dates. In addition, the admin has the right to set marks under each subject of students. After setting up student’s marks, the admin can view the overall result of each student with their CGPA. Besides, an admin can download student and faculty records.

# Student and Faculty Panel:-

On the other hand, a user can simply register as student by entering details such as name, university id, address, course, date of birth, and set up login details. Here, a student account has access to view his/her overall results on each subjects and edit their own user profile. In order to view results, the admin should first set marks on a particular student’s record. Similarly, faculty members can simply register and log into the system. A faculty member can take attendance of students, view overall attendance and update their profiles. So, the only responsibility of an faculty account is to maintain the attendance.
